## Development timeline

*Patch 5.77 Latest Version*

After round 3 user feedback, many reported a high satisfaction with the emulated results, with a whopping NS score of 89.

*Patch 3.14*

After round 2 user feedback, users reported visible puff, more similar to the day 2-3 of recovery (i.e. peak swelliness). However, some reported that the filter only served to enhance their masculine features of a sharp rectangular jawline.

*Patch 1.01*

After round 1 user feedback, some reported no noticeable face swelling, only an enhanced jawline. Improving our user's appearance was not the goal, so the puffiness was enhanced.

*Patch 1.00*

Beta version release after having my parents briefly come into my room and look at my camera, as with my pre-swollen cheeks I had difficulties evaluating how the lens was working
