## Development timeline

*Path 3.14*
After round 2 user feedback, users reported visible puff, more similar to the day 2-3 of recovery (i.e. peak swelliness). However, some reported that the filter only served to enhance their masculine features of a sharp rectangular jawline. This was also not acceptable.

*Patch 1.01*
After round 1 user feedback, some reported no noticeable face swelling, only an enhanced jawline. Improving our user's appearance was not the goal, so the puffiness was enhanced.

*Patch 1.00*
Beta version release after having my parents briefly come into my room and look at my camera, as with my pre-swollen cheeks I had difficulties evaluating how the lens was working
